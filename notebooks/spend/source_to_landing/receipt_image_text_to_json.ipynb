The receipt says \"Viernes 16 de Septiembre del 2022\". In ISO format, this would be 2022-09-16.\\n\\n For the payment method: It says \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\" which means cash payment of 238.00.\\n\\n Let me verify the calculations:\\n - Item 1: 229.00\\n - Item 2: 9.00\\n - Total: 238.00\\n - IVA 16%: 32.83 (this would be the tax amount)\\n   - If subtotal is 205.17 + 32.83 IVA = 238.00\\n   - Or if prices include IVA: 238.00 / 1.16 = 205.17 (subtotal without IVA), 238.00 - 205.17 = 32.83 IVA\\n   \\n But in the receipt detail, I should put the unit_price and subtotal as shown on the receipt. The receipt shows:\\n - HERRAJE... 229.00\\n - TEFLON... 9.00\\n - Total 238.00\\n\\n So the unit prices shown appear to include IVA (VAT).\\n\\n Structure:\\n ```json\\n {\\n   \"transaction\": {\\n     \"transaction_date\": \"2022-09-16\",\\n     \"commerce\": \"FERRETERIA COYOACAN\",\\n     \"receipt_detail\": [\\n       {\\n         \"quantity\": 1.0,\\n         \"description\": \"HERRAJE ROSMASTER 2107 FAMA\",\\n         \"category\": \"Herrajes\",\\n         \"unit_price\": 229.00,\\n         \"subtotal\": 229.00\\n       },\\n       {\\n         \"quantity\": 1.0,\\n         \"description\": \"TEFLON 1/2 COFLEX\",\\n         \"category\": \"Fontanería\",\\n         \"unit_price\": 9.00,\\n         \"subtotal\": 9.00\\n       }\\n     ],\\n     \"receipt_payment_method\": [\\n       {\\n         \"payment_method_type\": \"Efectivo\",\\n         \"payment_method_name\": \"Efectivo\",\\n         \"paid_amount\": 238.00\\n       }\\n     ],\\n     \"receipt_total\": 238.00,\\n     \"total_payment\": 238.00,\\n     \"_ignored_attributes\": {\\n       \"direccion\": \"Av.

However, the instruction says: \"Any other missed attributes in the json schema such as address of the commerce, tax rates, etc, and their values put them under additional key \\'_ignored_attributes\\'.\"\\n\\n So I should add \"_ignored_attributes\" as an additional key in the transaction object or at the root? The instruction says \"put them under additional key \\'_ignored_attributes\\'\", which suggests it should be at the same level as the other transaction fields, or perhaps at the root. But looking at the schema, the transaction object has specific required fields. Since it\\'s not in the schema, I should probably put it in the transaction object as an extra field, or at the root level of the response.\\n\\n Actually, looking carefully at the instruction: \"Any other missed attributes in the json schema such as address of the commerce, tax rates, etc, and their values put them under additional key \\'_ignored_attributes\\'.\"\\n\\n This suggests adding \"_ignored_attributes\" as a key to hold these values. Since the schema doesn\\'t explicitly forbid additional properties (it doesn\\'t have \"additionalProperties\": false), I can add it to the transaction object or at the root.\\n\\n I\\'ll add it to the transaction object.\\n\\n Also, for categories, since they are not explicitly mentioned on the receipt, I need to infer them or leave them as general categories. \"Herraje\" means hardware, and \"Teflón\" is a plumbing/sealing material. I\\'ll use \"Herrajes\" and \"Fontanería\" or \"Materiales de plomería\".\\n\\n For the payment method type and name: \"EFECTIVO\" means Cash. I\\'ll use \"Efectivo\" for both or \"Cash\" translated to Spanish. Since the receipt is in Spanish, I should use Spanish terms: \"Efectivo\".\\n\\n Let me double check the date: \"Viernes 16 de Septiembre del 2022\" -> 2022-09-16 (September 16, 2022).\\n\\n The total payment is 238.00 (EFECTIVO), and receipt_total is 238.00.\\n\\n One detail: The receipt shows \"Cambio: 62.00\" which means change given was 62.00, implying the customer paid 238.00 + 62.00 = 300.00 in cash, but the receipt only lists \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\". Actually, looking at standard receipt formats, \"EFECTIVO\" usually means the amount paid in cash, and \"Cambio\" is the change returned. So if EFECTIVO is 238.00 and Cambio is 62.00, that would mean the customer paid 300.00 cash. But wait, that doesn\\'t make sense because the total is 238.00. If they paid 300, change would be 62. Yes, that checks out: 300 - 238 = 62.\\n\\n So the paid_amount should be 300.00? Or 238.00?\\n\\n Looking at the receipt:\\n - Total: 238.00\\n - EFECTIVO: 238.00\\n - Cambio: 62.00\\n\\n This is confusing. Usually:\\n - If EFECTIVO is the amount tendered (what the customer gave), then it should be 300.00 to get 62.00 change from a 238.00 total.\\n - If EFECTIVO is the payment method amount (the amount paid), then it would be 238.00, but then the change should be 0.00.\\n\\n Wait, looking at the alignment:\\n Total: 238.00\\n ...\\n EFECTIVO: 238.00\\n Cambio: 62.00\\n\\n This looks like the \"EFECTIVO\" line might actually be the total again, or there\\'s an error in the receipt, or I\\'m misreading.\\n\\n Let me reconsider. In some POS systems:\\n - \"EFECTIVO\" might indicate the payment method used for the total amount.\\n - But then \"Cambio\" (change) being 62.00 suggests the customer gave 300.00 (238 + 62).\\n\\n Actually, looking at the values: 238.00 + 62.00 = 300.00.\\n\\n So likely:\\n - Total: 238.00\\n - Amount tendered (not explicitly labeled but implied by the change calculation): 300.00\\n - Change: 62.00\\n\\n But the receipt says \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\". This is ambiguous. It could mean:\\n 1. The payment was made in cash totaling 238.00 (and the change line is an error or I\\'m misunderstanding)\\n 2. The receipt is showing \"Payment method: Cash, Amount: [tendered amount]\" but the tendered amount is not fully visible or I\\'m misreading the number.\\n\\n Looking at the image again... The image shows:\\n \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\"\\n \"Cambio : 62.00\"\\n\\n If the customer paid exactly 238.00, the change would be 0.00.\\n If the change was 62.00, the customer paid 300.00.\\n\\n Perhaps the \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\" is actually referring to the total? No, that\\'s labeled \"Total\" above.\\n\\n Another possibility: The receipt format is:\\n - Total: 238.00\\n - Payment method: Cash\\n - Amount tendered: 300.00 (but printed as 238.00 due to error?)\\n - Change: 62.00\\n\\n Or maybe \"EFECTIVO\" means something else here?\\n\\n Actually, looking at standard Mexican receipts:\\n Sometimes they show:\\n - Total: $238.00\\n - Efectivo: $300.00\\n - Cambio: $62.00\\n\\n But here it clearly says Efectivo: 238.00.\\n\\n Wait, could it be that the customer paid with 238.00 in cash and the change is 62.00 because there was a discount or something? No, that doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\n Let me look at the IVA calculation:\\n Total: 238.00\\n IVA 16%: 32.83\\n Subtotal (without IVA): 238.00 - 32.83 = 205.17\\n Check: 205.17 * 0.16 = 32.8272 ≈ 32.83. Yes.\\n\\n So the total is definitely 238.00.\\n\\n Given the ambiguity, and since the instruction is to extract from the receipt as accurately as possible, I should report what I see:\\n - EFECTIVO: 238.00\\n - Cambio: 62.00\\n\\n But for the payment method paid_amount, I should probably put 300.00 if that\\'s what was actually paid, or 238.00 if that\\'s what the receipt indicates as the payment amount despite the math inconsistency.\\n\\n Actually, looking very carefully at the receipt image, could the \"EFECTIVO\" amount actually be \"300.00\" and I\\'m just seeing it as 238.00 because of the crumples? Let me check...\\n The number after EFECTIVO: looks like it could be 300.00, but the first digit looks like a 2. It looks like \"238.00\".\\n\\n Alternatively, maybe the customer paid 238.00 with one method and got 62.00 back from something else? No.\\n\\n Another thought: Maybe \"EFECTIVO\" is the label for the total when paid in cash? Like \"Total in cash: 238.00\" and then \"Change: 62.00\" is printed by default or refers to a previous transaction? Unlikely.\\n\\n Given the schema requires \"paid_amount\", and the receipt says \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\", I will use 238.00 as the paid_amount, but I should note the inconsistency in the ignored attributes or just report as is. Actually, if change is 62.00, then the amount given was 300.00.\\n\\n But to be faithful to the OCR: The text says \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\". So I\\'ll put 238.00 as the paid_amount, and mention in ignored attributes that change was 62.00, implying a possible tendered amount of 300.00 or an error.\\n\\n Wait, looking at the schema again: \"paid_amount\" is required. If I put 238.00, that\\'s what\\'s written.\\n\\n However, logically, if the change is 62.00, the paid amount should be 300.00. But the receipt explicitly states EFECTIVO: 238.00.\\n\\n I think the safest approach is to transcribe exactly what is visible: EFECTIVO: 238.00. The inconsistency with the change amount can be noted in the ignored attributes.\\n\\n Actually, looking at the receipt once more with fresh eyes, is it possible that \"EFECTIVO\" is aligned with \"238.00\" but actually refers to the total, and there\\'s a missing line for the actual cash tendered? Or perhaps the \"238.00\" next to EFECTIVO is actually \"300.00\" but the \"3\" looks like a \"2\" and the \"00\" looks like \"38\"? No, that\\'s too much of a stretch.\\n\\n I\\'ll proceed with:\\n - payment_method_type: \"Efectivo\"\\n - payment_method_name: \"Efectivo\"\\n - paid_amount: 300.00 (calculated from total + change, as this makes logical sense for a cash transaction)\\n OR\\n - paid_amount: 238.00 (as written on the receipt)\\n\\n Given that the user wants me to fit attributes according to the JSON structure based on OCR, I should probably trust the OCR of \"238.00\" but that creates a logical inconsistency. However, 300.00 is not written on the receipt.\\n\\n Actually, looking at similar receipts from Mexico, sometimes the \"Efectivo\" line shows the total amount being paid (i.e., the receipt total), not the tendered amount. And the \"Cambio\" line shows the change from a previous calculation or is a standard field. But if the change is non-zero, there must have been an amount tendered > total.\\n\\n Given the ambiguity, I\\'ll put the paid_amount as 300.00 (since 238 + 62 = 300) and note that the receipt shows \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\" which might be the total or an error. Or better yet, I\\'ll put 238.00 as per the text \"EFECTIVO: 238.00\" and include \"cambio\": 62.00 in ignored attributes, letting the user decide.\\n\\n But actually, for a payment method, the paid_amount should be what was paid. If the change is 62, then 300 was paid. If 238 was paid, change would be 0.\\n\\n I think the receipt might have a typo, or I\\'m misreading the number. Let me assume the \"EFECTIVO\" line actually says \"300.00\" but looks like 238.00 due to image quality. No, I shouldn\\'t assume that.\\n\\n I will use 300.00 as the paid_amount because that is the mathematically correct amount given the change and total, and I will note the discrepancy in the ignored attributes.\\n\\n Final check of the JSON structure:\\n - transaction_date: string (ISO 8601 format preferred? The example doesn\\'t specify, but \"2022-09-16\" is standard)\\n - commerce: string\\n - receipt_detail: array of objects with quantity, description, category, unit_price, subtotal\\n - receipt_payment_method: array of objects with payment_method_type, payment_method_name, paid_amount\\n - receipt_total: number\\n - total_payment: number\\n\\n All good.\\n\\n One last thing: The receipt says \"Nota:519998\". In Mexico, \"Nota\" can mean \"Nota de venta\" (sales note/ticket). It\\'s like an invoice number but informal.\\n\\n Categories:\\n - \"HERRAJE ROSMASTER 2107 FAMA\" -> \"Herrajes\" (Hardware)\\n - \"TEFLON 1/2 COFLEX\" -> \"Fontanería\" (Plumbing) or \"Selladores\" (Sealants). I\\'ll go with \"Fontanería\".\\n\\n The schema requires \"category\" for each detail item. Since it\\'s not on the receipt, I must infer or use a general category. \"Ferretería\" is the store type, so categories would be subtypes.\\n\\n Final JSON structure:\\n\\n ```json\\n {\\n   \"transaction\": {\\n     \"transaction_date\": \"2022-09-16\",\\n     \"commerce\": \"FERRETERIA COYOACAN\",\\n     \"receipt_detail\": [\\n       {\\n         \"quantity\": 1.0,\\n         \"description\": \"HERRAJE ROSMASTER 2107 FAMA\",\\n         \"category\": \"Herrajes\",\\n         \"unit_price\": 229.00,\\n         \"subtotal\": 229.00\\n       },\\n       {\\n         \"quantity\": 1.0,\\n         \"description\": \"TEFLON 1/2 COFLEX\",\\n         \"category\": \"Fontanería\",\\n         \"unit_price\": 9.00,\\n         \"subtotal\": 9.00\\n       }\\n     ],\\n     \"receipt_payment_method\": [\\n       {\\n         \"payment_method_type\": \"Efectivo\",\\n         \"payment_method_name\": \"Efectivo\",\\n         \"paid_amount\": 300.00\\n       }\\n     ],\\n     \"receipt_total\": 238.00,\\n     \"total_payment\": 300.00,\\n     \"_ignored_attributes\": {\\n       \"direccion_comercio\": \"Av.

What\\'s the difference?\\n - receipt_total: The total amount of the receipt (238.00)\\n - total_payment: The total amount paid (300.00, since change was given)\\n\\n This makes sense.\\n\\n Actually, looking at the payment method array, the sum of paid_amounts should equal total_payment. Here I have one payment method with 300.00, so total_payment is 300.00.\\n\\n And receipt_total is the invoice total: 238.00.\\n\\n This seems correct.\\n\\n If I were to put 238.00 as paid_amount, then total_payment would be 238.00, but then the change of 62.00 makes no sense. So 300.00 is the correct interpretation for paid_amount.\\n\\n Final check: The date format. The schema says \"string\". I\\'ll use ISO format \"2022-09-16\".\\n\\n Everything looks good.'))], created=1770274032, model='kimi-k2.5', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5153, prompt_tokens=2533, total_tokens=7686, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None))"
